# Step 2: Prepare your Device

TrustBox comes with Ubuntu OS pre-installed. Follow the [Quick Start](https://scalys.com/wp-content/uploads/TrustBox_Edge_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf) instructions to start boot TrustBox and configure either wireless or wired network.

## 2.1 Update iotedge

Update the iotedge on the device to the latest available release:

    sed -i 's/1.0.8-rc1/1.0/' /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/multiarch/prod bionic main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    apt update
    apt install iotedge
    
## 2.2 Configure iotedge

Configure iotedge with connection string:

    perl -ne 's/(?<=device_connection_string: ")[^"]*/<PUT YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE>/g; print;' -i /etc/iotedge/config.yaml

or by editing /etc/iotedge/config.yaml manually.

Restart the iotedge:

    systemctl restart iotedge

## 3.1 Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed with the default TrustBox firmware:

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib`

*Edge Runtime Enabled:*

**Check the iotedge daemon command:** 

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device, confirm that the Azure IoT edge Daemon is under running state

    systemctl status iotedge

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device, confirm that the module deployed from the cloud is running on your IoT Edge device

    iotedge list

 ![](./media/TrustBox/containers.png) 

On the device details page of the Azure, you should see the runtime modules - edgeAgent, edgeHub and tempSensor modueles are under running status
